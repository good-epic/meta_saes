So we have run the full grid search that we specified. The outputs are all in the outputs folder under the only grid search subfolder. Honestly, I don't really remember what it is that we were doing a grid search over. And I also don't really...  I know exactly how to assess. I mean, presumably we need to do some level of assessment or some measure of reconstruction of the activations by the primary SAE and also the level of composability as measured by the success of the meta-SAE, the reconstruction of the meta-SAE, I suppose.  Like we want high primary SAE reconstruction and low meta SAE reconstruction. But how to balance those seems to sort of like a judgment call. Can you just remind me what we were doing the grid search over and then without writing any code,  Give me your start of your recommendation about how to go about assessing these.
